# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.

# Enable traceflow which provides packet tracing feature to diagnose network issue.
#  Traceflow: true

# Enable Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy for cluster admins
# to define security policies which apply to the entire cluster, and Antrea NetworkPolicy
# feature that supports priorities, rule actions and externalEntities in the future.
#  AntreaPolicy: false

# Enable collecting and exposing NetworkPolicy statistics.
#  NetworkPolicyStats: false

# The port for the antrea-controller APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-controller` container must be set to the same value.
#apiPort: 10349

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.

# Indicates whether to use auto-generated self-signed TLS certificate.
# If false, A Secret named "antrea-controller-tls" must be provided with the following keys:
#   ca.crt: <CA certificate>
#   tls.crt: <TLS certificate>
#   tls.key: <TLS private key>
# And the Secret must be mounted to directory "/var/run/antrea/antrea-controller-tls" of the
# antrea-controller container.

# Comma-separated list of cipher suites. If omitted, the default Go cipher suites will be used.
# https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants
# Note that Antrea is using old version of k8s.io/component-base, so TLS1.3 Cipher suites cannot be explicitly listed here but
# the apiserver can still use TLS1.3 Cipher Suites in practice and as preferred.
